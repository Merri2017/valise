## Acknowledgments

* I was inspired by my love of fairytales and my future goal of traveling and immersing in various cultures. Valise is an antiquated word for suitcase. My hope is that you'll get a glimpse of who I am as a person, all the lovely things that inspire me, and a story - documenting my journey as a Web Developer.
